Prototype website made for demonstrative purposes.
This was my first coding project, made before I had any formal training, to be honest, looking back, I can't say I'm dissapointed with how it turned out.
While it is a decent demonstration of what I can do with no prior experience, my code, as a whole has become much more legible and concise since then.
Basically, this is here for posterity, I will not be updating it further.
